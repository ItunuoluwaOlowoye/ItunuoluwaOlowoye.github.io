							<h1>Who's Making Money in Movies?</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Movies are a popular pastime and, perhaps, a part of our culture. The end of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first saw a significant expansion of media culture. The United States (Hollywood) has been a key player in this expansion. The current Big Five major studio conglomerates are NBC Universal, Paramount Global, Warner Media, Walt Disney Studios, and Sony Pictures, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_film_studios">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
							<p> Movies like  Jurassic World, The Fast and Furious franchise, Titanic, the Transformers franchise, Harry Potter, Aquaman, The Lion King, and the great (in my delightful opinion) MCU movies have all captured our hearts.
								Every movie production company hopes to make movies that will generate more profit. Some do, while others do not. Is there a pattern here? Is profit determined by the number of movies produced? Is it based on genre or audience sentiment?
								</p>
							<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19q2okpMtgg5k2V4ESOQUBZdhlx136UHSH5spy6RvIUw/edit?resourcekey=0-k4IWzBLzsFbc8LjzO3KV6g#gid=0">Grow with Google</a> has information from 508 Hollywood movies that were released between 2012 and 2016. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/187122/movie-releases-in-north-america-since-2001/">Statistica</a>, 3,509 films were released in the United States and Canada during this period.
								The appropriate <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/sample-size-calculator/">sample size</a> is 347 movies (using a 95% confidence limit and a 5% margin of error). As a result, the available data is adequate. I decided to delve deeper and gain a quantitative understanding of trends associated with increased profit.</p>
							<p>The plot below shows the number of movies released each year and the gross amount of profit made.</p>
							<p><span class="image main"></span><iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQLYZr_dEDZEnce9TFEPNrTAzlcDgsqbLBpIbGtRpCrYqltkt5_ClFQ0IBUaPPooU-aECEBhieTwbAF/pubchart?oid=647886229&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></p>
							<p>Although one might be tempted to believe that releasing more movies will result in higher annual profits, the chart suggests otherwise. From 2012 to 2013, the number of movies released decreased, as did the amount of profit made. Profit increased in 2014 as more movies were released. However, much more movies were released in 2015, but profits dropped significantly. There must be a more important element at play than simply releasing more movies.</p>
							<p>I took a close look at the data from 2015. 124 films were released in 2015. I've plotted the primary genres into which these movies fall in the chart below. It is arranged by the number of movies in each genre from highest to lowest.</p>
							<p><span class="image main"></span> <iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQLYZr_dEDZEnce9TFEPNrTAzlcDgsqbLBpIbGtRpCrYqltkt5_ClFQ0IBUaPPooU-aECEBhieTwbAF/pubchart?oid=700776128&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></p>
							<p>According to the chart, drama movies had the highest number of releases in 2015. So, how much profit do drama movies and other genres make in comparison to each other? To answer this question, I plotted the percentage of profit generated by each movie genre in 2015.</p>
							<p><span class="image main"></span><iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQLYZr_dEDZEnce9TFEPNrTAzlcDgsqbLBpIbGtRpCrYqltkt5_ClFQ0IBUaPPooU-aECEBhieTwbAF/pubchart?oid=604373539&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></p>
							<p>According to the chart above, action movies made the most profit in 2015, followed closely by sci-fi movies. Drama movies, on the other hand, accounted for less than 10% of the profit that year.</p>
							<p>Even though more movies were released in 2015 than in previous years, profit fell because more drama movies were released, which were less profitable. This implies that to maximize profit, the movie genre is an important factor to consider when releasing movies.</p>
							<p>To test this hypothesis, I plotted the profit generated by each movie genre over the entire period (from 2012 to 2016).</p>
							<p><span class="image main"><iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQLYZr_dEDZEnce9TFEPNrTAzlcDgsqbLBpIbGtRpCrYqltkt5_ClFQ0IBUaPPooU-aECEBhieTwbAF/pubchart?oid=224184099&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></span>
							<p>This plot proves that action movies consistently generate more profit for the movie industry. It is clear that moviegoers enjoy watching action movies, and the film industry can capitalize on this knowledge by releasing more action films. They make more money as a result, and it's a win-win situation for both parties.</p>
