                           Grandpa Oluboyede, my maternal granddad's best friend, got me my first jigsaw
                           puzzle set on my 5th birthday. It was a 50-piece puzzle with words and their opposites written on it.
                           That was when I became a puzzle nerd. My stepmum also gifted me puzzles when
                           I visited her and they got progressively harder as I grew older, from 100-piece puzzles
                           to 250, 500, 750, and finally 1000. I love them and imagine to have a library with puzzle sets one day.

                           One thing I love more than hearing amazing singers? Watching people with the most
                           insane of talents. The first season of America's Got Talent: Fantasy League was like
                           a dream come true for me because the nostalgia of seeing most of my favorite acts was
                           amazing. Sofie Dossi, the contortionist; Aidan Bryant, same; VUnbeatable, the Indian dance
                           crew; Kseniya, the sand artist...I could go on and on. Literal chills. I'm learning how to
                           dance LA Salsa. Will I get to Got Talent level is another question entirely.

                           I LOVE music. I can't sing but learning how to play the strings rock-and-roll style is definitely
                           in my retirement bucket list. It's a joy for me to enjoy the talent of normal people who have
                           incredible singing talents. I couldn't possibly pick a favorite contestant but
                           two memorable people are Jordan Smith (USA) and Chike (NG). My favorite franchise,
                           though, is The Voice Australia. They have amazing talent, the judges are incredible,
                           the production is top-notch, and the winners are undisputable.
