							<h1>The success/failure story of a product launch</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Next year, a home improvement store (which I'll call HomeShapers) plans to add indoor paint to its product line. According to the finance department, the product must be sold for $50 per paint bucket to break even.</p>
							<p> To be successful, the product launch must be both relevant to customer needs and economically feasible. The first step to determine this was to conduct a customer survey for HomeShapers. HomeShapers serves 10,000 customers on average per year. The survey required 370 responses (95% confidence limit and 5% margin of error) <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/sample-size-calculator/">(Sample size calculator)</a></p>
							<p>HomeShapers received approximately 5,000 customer email addresses last year. A survey was mailed to these customers earlier this year. It drew 620 responses. Even though this equates to a response rate of only 12%, it is an effective sample size. It also increases the likelihood that an email survey will be successful again.<p>
							<p>The survey asked the following questions</p>
							<li>How often do you do home improvements a year?</li>
							<li>How much money do you spend each year on home improvements?</li>
							<p>These first two questions were used to provide context for the following questions.</p>
							<li>Do you intend to complete a painting project in your home within the next year?</li>
							<p>Given that the product is scheduled to be released next year, the answers to this question will provide insight into sales performance.</p>
							<li>If you said yes to question 3, how much money do you intend to spend on indoor paint for the project?</li>
							<p>This indicates how much customers are willing to pay for the product. This will determine whether it is profitable or not. To aid analysis, the question provided a set of pre-programmed answers.</p>
							<li>If you answered yes to question 3, how likely are you to use HomeShapers' indoor paint for your project?</li>
							<p>It is insufficient to know that customers will purchase the new product. We need to know if they will purchase it from this particular store. To aid analysis, the question provided a set of pre-programmed answers.</p>
							<li>What are your favorite colors for interior painting?</li>
							<p>If the product launch is expected to be successful, this will inform what colors to stock up on.</p>
							<p>The survey was carried out, and 541 people responded. The information was compiled and cleaned on a spreadsheet. Data that lacked critical information were excluded, and 370 responses from the cleaned dataset were used for analysis.</p>
							<p><b><u>Analysis</u></b></p>
							<p>The first step was to determine how many customers complete home improvement projects each year. I created a chart that shows the percentage of customers who do these projects every year as well as how frequently they do them.</p>
							<p><span class="image main"></span><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTWpKfq26MjWBLYYT23akmStR4x-oLBVGjUh1xc7c4b_pVK7afVgag-MGck48SXWP1cU4FVUQYhh-Yr/pubchart?oid=1585947761&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></p>
							<p>66.2% of customers polled say they make home improvements at least once a year. This means that it is a primary consumer need, as customers of home improvement stores would expect.</p>
							<p>The pertinent question, however, is whether providing paint is a significant need, particularly in the coming year. I plotted the responses of customers who were asked if they had any painting projects planned for the coming year.</p>
							<p><span class="image main"></span><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTWpKfq26MjWBLYYT23akmStR4x-oLBVGjUh1xc7c4b_pVK7afVgag-MGck48SXWP1cU4FVUQYhh-Yr/pubchart?oid=1982318940&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></p>
							<p>Less than half of all customers intend to paint their homes next year. This means that customers will not have a pressing need for this item next year.</p>
							<p>The next question is whether the customers who require it are willing to pay a reasonable price for it. For the product launch to be successful, they must be able to pay more than $50. To answer this, I divided the percentage of customers with painting needs in the coming year by the price ranges they were willing to pay.</p>
							<p><span class="image main"></span><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTWpKfq26MjWBLYYT23akmStR4x-oLBVGjUh1xc7c4b_pVK7afVgag-MGck48SXWP1cU4FVUQYhh-Yr/pubchart?oid=1970652859&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></p>
							<p>Only 24.4% of customers are willing to pay more than $50 for indoor paint next year. While this already suggests that the new product launch may fail, the final question to be answered was whether or not these customers will purchase the paint from HomeShapers.</p>
							<p>I've plotted the percentage of customers who are very likely to buy from HomeShapers and are willing to pay more than $50.</p>
							<p><span class="image main"></span><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTWpKfq26MjWBLYYT23akmStR4x-oLBVGjUh1xc7c4b_pVK7afVgag-MGck48SXWP1cU4FVUQYhh-Yr/pubchart?oid=1808992381&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></p>
							<p>Less than a quarter of customers are willing to pay more than $50 for indoor paint next year, but far fewer are willing to buy from HomeShapers! This will necessitate further analysis to determine why HomeShapers is not the first choice for many of their customers.</p>
							<p>It is clear, however, that launching indoor paint as a new product next year will be a failure.</p>
							<p>HomeShapers will need answers to two questions to solve this business problem. First, what products do customers require that are currently unavailable at HomeShapers? Second, why aren't they the first choice for many of their customers?</p>
