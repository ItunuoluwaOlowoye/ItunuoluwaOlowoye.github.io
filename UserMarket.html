							<h1>The success/failure story of a product launch</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p><b><u>Background:</u></b></p>
							<p>Next year, a home improvement store (HomeShapers) that serves 10,000 customers per year on average plans to add indoor paint to its product line. According to the finance department, the product must be sold for $50 per paint bucket to break even.</p>
							<p>A survey was mailed to these customers earlier this year and drew 620 responses. This equates to a response rate of only 12%, but it is an effective sample size.<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/sample-size-calculator/">(Sample size calculator)</a></p>
							<p>The survey asked the following questions:</p>
							<li>How often do you do home improvements a year?</li>
							<li>How much money do you spend each year on home improvements?</li>
							<p>These first two questions were used to provide context for the following questions.</p>
							<li>Do you intend to complete a painting project in your home within the next year?</li>
							<p>Given that the product is scheduled to be released next year, the answers to this question will provide insight into sales performance.</p>
							<li>If you said yes to question 3, how much money do you intend to spend on indoor paint for the project?</li>
							<p>This indicates how much customers are willing to pay for the product. This will determine whether it is profitable or not. To aid analysis, the question provided a set of pre-programmed answers.</p>
							<li>If you answered yes to question 3, how likely are you to use HomeShapers' indoor paint for your project?</li>
							<p>It is insufficient to know that customers will purchase the new product. We need to know if they will purchase it from this particular store. To aid analysis, the question provided a set of pre-programmed answers.</p>
							<li>What are your favorite colors for interior painting?</li>
							<p>If the product launch is expected to be successful, this will inform what colors to stock up on.</p>
							<p>The survey was carried out, and 541 people responded. The data was compiled, cleaned, and analyzed on a spreadsheet.</p>
							<p><b><u>Analysis:</u></b></p>
							<p>The first step was to determine how many customers complete home improvement projects each year. I created a chart that shows the percentage of customers who do these projects every year as well as how frequently they do them.</p>
							<p><span class="image main"></span><iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTWpKfq26MjWBLYYT23akmStR4x-oLBVGjUh1xc7c4b_pVK7afVgag-MGck48SXWP1cU4FVUQYhh-Yr/pubchart?oid=1585947761&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></p>
							<p>Home improvement is a primary consumer need, and 66.2% of customers polled say they make home improvements at least once a year. </p>
							<p>I plotted the responses of customers to whether they had any painting projects planned for the coming year.</p>
							<p><span class="image main"></span><iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTWpKfq26MjWBLYYT23akmStR4x-oLBVGjUh1xc7c4b_pVK7afVgag-MGck48SXWP1cU4FVUQYhh-Yr/pubchart?oid=1982318940&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></p>
							<p>Less than half of all customers intend to paint their homes next year. For this product launch to be successful, customers must be willing to pay more than $50 for it. </p>
							<p>To answer this question, I have divided the percentage of customers with painting needs in the coming year by the price ranges they were prepared to pay.</p>
							<p><span class="image main"></span><iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTWpKfq26MjWBLYYT23akmStR4x-oLBVGjUh1xc7c4b_pVK7afVgag-MGck48SXWP1cU4FVUQYhh-Yr/pubchart?oid=1970652859&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></p>
							<p>Only 24.4% of customers are willing to pay more than $50 for indoor paint next year. This suggests that the new HomeShapers product launch may fail.</p>
							<p>The last key question is whether or not these customers will purchase the paint from HomeShapers.</p>
							<p><span class="image main"></span><iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTWpKfq26MjWBLYYT23akmStR4x-oLBVGjUh1xc7c4b_pVK7afVgag-MGck48SXWP1cU4FVUQYhh-Yr/pubchart?oid=1808992381&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></p>
							<p>It is clear that launching indoor paint as a new product next year will be a failure, and HomeShapers will need answers to two questions to solve this business problem.</p>
							<p>First, what products do customers require that are currently unavailable at HomeShaper? Second, why aren't they the first choice for many of their customers? </p>
							<p>Less than a quarter of customers are willing to pay more than $50 for indoor paint next year, but far fewer are willing to buy from them.</p>

							<p>To do this research, a modified version of a customer survey spreadsheet from a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1PS1JR6AIe-CPbSqsbDPmi3TNVRoYBsIUsiHC6myMftI/edit">Grow with Google</a> course was used.</p>
