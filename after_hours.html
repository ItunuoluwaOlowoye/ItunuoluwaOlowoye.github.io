                                puzzle set on my 5th birthday. It was a 50-piece puzzle with words and their opposites written on it.
                                That was when I became a puzzle nerd. My stepmum also gifted me puzzles when
                                I visited her and they got progressively harder as I grew older, from 100-piece puzzles
                                to 250, 500, 750, and finally 1000. I love them and imagine to have a library with puzzle sets one day.

                                had such an amazing personality (cue, the butter episode) and Reynold Poernomo, the KING of desserts

                                I LOVE music. I can't sing but learning how to play the strings rock-and-roll style is definitely
                                in my retirement bucket list. It's a joy for me to enjoy the talent of normal people who have
                                incredible singing talents. I couldn't possibly pick a favorite contestant but
                                two memorable people are Jordan Smith (USA) and Chike (NG). My favorite franchise,
                                though, is The Voice Australia. They have amazing talent, the judges are incredible,
                                the production is top-notch, and the winners are undisputable.

                                a dream come true for me because the nostalgia of seeing most of my favorite acts was
                                amazing. Sofie Dossi, the contortionist; Aidan Bryant, same; VUnbeatable, the Indian dance
